This program implements a queue using a vector through a class called Queue. The class has member functions 

- insert() : inserts element at back of the queue using .pushback() vector method 

- pop() : returns and removes element at front of the queue using .erase() vector method 

- top() ; returns but does not remove element at front of queue by accessing first element via index 

- queueSizes() : returns size of the queue by using .size() vector method 

- isEmpty() : returns boolean indicating if the userâ€™s queue is empty by using .empty() vector method 

 

When run, a while loop begins.  The queue is presented to the user as though it is an empty waiting list of people, and asks the user what they would like to do to the waitlist. The user then inputs their choice and the corresponding action is carried out. After each action is completed, the user is asked if they would like to do anything more. If yes the program loops back and the menu to the user again, and if no the program ends
